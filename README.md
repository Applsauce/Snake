Snake Clone in C#
Simply run the Snake.exe and a window will appear with a purple, and a red square. The Purple square is you,
the player, and the red is the food. Control your snake with either WASDA or arrows, and navigate your way to the food
to gain more parts, and more points. Make sure to avoid the sides, and your own parts to win!

In the pause meny (accssessed by ESCAPE) or by thhe gameover meny you can set the snake speed, and play a musicfile. 
The game can play a file titled Snake_Music.mp3 in your documents if you wish. After each game you will be shown your
score, and previous highscores. The Highscores are located in Snake_Highscore.txt , whihc will be created for the game 
at the first failure state.
